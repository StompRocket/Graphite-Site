      <h1>Graphite Writer Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>Our goal is to provide a secure and privacy conscious service, however we take no responsibility for a loss or
        release of information.</p>

      <h1>How we collect information</h1>

      <h2>When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it</h2>

      <p>When you sign up for or use Graphite Writer you voluntarily share certain information including your name,
        email address, preferred language, and any other information you give us. Additionally we use your IP address to
        determine your approximate location.</p>

      <h2>Technical information</h2>

      <p>When you use Graphite Writer certain internet and electronic network activity information gets created and
        logged automatically. Here are some of the types of information we collect:
        - <strong>Log data</strong>: When you use Graphite Writer our servers record information (“log data”), including
        information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit a website. This log data includes your
        Internet Protocol address (which we use to infer your approximate location), browser type and settings, the date
        and time of your request, how you used Graphite Writer, cookie data and device data.
        - <strong>Cookie Data</strong>: We also use “cookies” (small text files sent by your computer each time you
        visit our website, unique to your Graphite Writer account or your browser) or similar technologies to get log
        data. When we use cookies or other similar technologies, we use session cookies (that last until you close your
        browser) or persistent cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we use cookies to
        store your language preferences or other settings so you don‘t have to set them up every time you visit Graphite
        Writer. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Graphite Writer account (including information about
        you, such as the email address you gave us) and other cookies are not.
        - <strong>Device information</strong>: In addition to log data, we collect information about the device you’re
        using Graphite Writer on, including the type of device, operating system, settings, unique device identifiers
        and crash data that helps us understand when something breaks.</p>

      <h2>User Content</h2>

      <p>When ever you create, edit, view, or upload a document to Graphite Writer we store that document along with
        timestamps, metadata, and who has viewed it.</p>

      <h1>What we do with your information</h1>

      <p>Graphite Writer is a free and open source service. We are not in the business of selling personal information.
        We use your data for research purposes and to better understand how our users use your service in order to
        improve it.</p>

      <p>We never sell your information to third-parties.
        However we do share some user information with third parties in these cases:
        - <strong>Law enforcement agencies or government agencies</strong>: We only share information if we believe that
        disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety,
        rights, or property of the public, any person, or Pinterest; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud,
        security or technical issues.
        - <strong>Analytics</strong>: We share some information with Google Analytics in order to better understand how
        our users use our service</p>

      <h1>How we keep your information</h1>

      <p>We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Graphite Writer to you and fulfill the purposes
        described in this policy. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it
        to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it
        so that we can't identify you.</p>

      <h1>Your options</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>Request access to the information we collect and hold about you. We'll usually share this with you within 30
          days of you emailing us.
